## Calculator App

### A calculator app made all of react.js

* An application contains no outside libraries except 'gh-pages'
* Context API has been used to create a data store
* CSS Grid has been used to create styles
* Binding keys have beed added to improve the use experience

I've crerated this one to check how I can handle with pure React software without any helpers. I hope you'll like it.
